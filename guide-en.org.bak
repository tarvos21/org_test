#+TITLE: A Guide for Resume Writing and Typesetting
#+AUTHOR: http://ppresume.com

* Preface

The resume is your face.

In a piece of A4, 210mm * 297mm, a resume ends the previous stage of life and starts the next one.

"A nine-storey tower arises from a pile of earth."(/Laozi/, chapter 64) Likewise, a pretty-print resume is based on details of font, punctuation, layout and grammar.

This guide will systematically explain the essentials of resume writing and typesetting with particular emphasis on typography, helping you make a resume pretty both in form and spirit. For each topic, we will first explain WHAT it is, then WHY it is so, and finally HOW to do it.

The guide is trying to be as concise and clear as possible, for different declarations there are four levels of priorities:
- MUST, mandatory in typesetting, serious mistake if violated
- SHOULD, conform to general typesetting standards, highly recommended
- SHOULD NOT, require advanced knowledge or features in typesetting, or diverse in different languages and cultures, or vary with regulations in companies, dangerous to use if not informed
- MUST NOT, conflict with general typesetting standards, forbidden to apply

* Font

As text transmits information, the visual feature of the text itself---font---will affect the quality of transmission.

In principle, the typesetting of a resume should be concise and clear. As for font, first you should never use fonts that are too fancy, second the types of fonts should not be too many---best limited in three. Here we will discuss some basics of fonts and main points in typesetting.

** Font classification

*** Serif vs. sans-serif

In terms of serifs, fonts for Latin alphabet are divided into two families: serif and sans-serif[1].

A serif is a tiny line attached to the end of a stroke in a letter. A font with serifs is called serif font, or serifed font. In contrast, a font without serifs is called sans-serif font, from the French /sans/, meaning "without".

*** Proportional vs. monospaced

According to whether or not the widths of characters are the same, fonts can be divided into monospaced and proportional. As the name suggests, all letters in a monospaced font occupy the same amount of horizontal space, while in a proportional font they don't.

# + CAPTION: Proportional fonts and monospaced fonts
# + NAME: image: proportional-and-monospaced-font
[[static/notes/guide/images/1280px-Propvsmono.svg.png]]

In traditional printing, proportional fonts can improve the legibility of words. Due to technical limitations, the early computers and typewriters can not adjust the widths of characters. So all characters are made into the same width, thus monospaced fonts come into being. With the improvement of computer technology, the GUI(graphical user interface) has become the mainstream and been developing continuously; technical limitations no longer exist, so proportional fonts have become quite popular, since they are more naturally legible for human.

** Font design and usage

Digital Publishing has been developing for many years, and the writing system of English or other similar languages actually has a very small character set, so there are many many kinds of fonts designed by different people with various demands.

For a monospaced font, the main focus is on the design of each single letter, other than that, in a proportional font, the space between letters should also be seriously considered.

*** Letter composition

Letters in every font have a consistent structure, font users are supposed to know these basic concepts:

- baseline: the invisible line on which "H" or "n" stands
- cap height: the distance from baseline to the top of a linear uppercase letter like "H" or "E"
- x-height: the distance from the bottom to the top of lowercase "x"
- ascender: the ascending parts of lowercase letters like "b", "d", "f", "h", "k", "l" over the top of "x" , its height is called the ascender height, the top line which ascenders align is called the ascender line
- descender: the descending parts of lowercase letters like "g", "j", "p", "q", "y" below the baseline, its height is called the descender height, the bottom line which descenders align is called the descender line

*** Letter-spacing

Letter-spacing, or tracking, refers to the space between letters. Letter-spacing adjustment is divided into font designers' side and font users' side; it affects the density in a line or block of text.

For font designers, adjusting the letter-spacing is an important procedure in designing. In a proportional font, the spacing on the left side of a single letter does not necessarily equal that on the right side. The purpose is to ensure readability when the letter is adjacent to whatever other letters on either side.

For font users, the letter-spacing adjustment means manually rearranging the space between letters by software after the original typesetting, in order to obtain special alignment[4], or a better layout effect[5].

*** Kerning

Kerning refers to the process of increasing or decreasing the space between specific letter pairs in a proportional font. These pairs are called kerning pairs. Kerning is more concerned about the visual spacing rather than the actual spacing.

Designers of many fonts will pay attention to kerning pairs while designing, and store kerning adjustment values in the font file. In this way, typesetting software can automatically adjust spacing in kerning pairs according to the values, and thus produce a better layout effect.

Every letter has a unique shape, so during the design and implementation of a font, letters in all kerning pairs must cooperate to produce the best visual effect. In fact, this is where the key procedure and difficulties lie.

*** Ligature

A ligature is a glyph that joins two or more letters together.

Printing ligatures originate from letters combined in handwriting. After the birth of movable-type printing, many ligatures were directly made into type. However, in the 1950s, sans-serif fonts began to be widely used, and in the 1970s phototypesetting was invented, so gradually ligatures were rarely used. The earliest software that could use ligatures for digital typesetting is TeX created by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth]Donald Knuth]]. This trend also affected the typesetting technology on computer desktop after 1985. In early times, software could not replace letters with ligatures(but TeX could), and most of the newly made fonts for computers did not include ligatures. Furthermore, early personal computers mostly displayed English, and ligatures are not necessary for English, so there was no real need. With the development of digital typesetting technology such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType][OpenType]]), ligatures has gradually returned to practice[7].

In general daily business documents, absence of ligatures will not be treated as spelling error, but for professional typesetting in advertising, book publishing and other fields, ligatures are essentially required[8].

*** Italics

Italics are fonts in which the letters slant slightly to the right. Italics are based on normal font style, and refer to italic type or oblique type.

In italic type, forms of letters are changed compared with the normal type, while in oblique type, letters are merely tilted right without any modification on the forms. Oblique type is simply realized through algorithms in software, as a result, the strokes of letters will appear loose. Recently, more and more designs are inclined to apply newly designed italic type.

Theoretically, italics include italic type and oblique type, but it should be noticed that actually not all italic type are slanted .

In practice, italics are usually applied to one piece of text to emphasize or distinguish it from the main body that is in serif fonts.

*** Combined font solution

There are tons of fonts out there nowadays, so to commend a universal combined font solution for resumes is not so easy as it may seem to be.

- RECOMMEND, using serif fonts in the main body
- RECOMMEND, using sans-serif fonts for titles, but serif fonts can also be used
- RECOMMEND, using fonts in italic type to emphasize text in main body, corresponding bold style can also be used
- Commonly used serif fonts

* Punctuation

Punctuation is the most humble but most error-prone place in CV writing. Whether the correct and standardized use of punctuation marks reflect the job applicants attitude.

Correct and punctual use of punctuation, it seems easy to implement it is not imagined so simple. The main reason for this is that the use of punctuation in different locales is either unspecified or normative, but is not clearly defined in many places or has multiple sets of style guidelines ([[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki / Style_guide] [Style Guide]]) But they are not compatible with each other and even conflict; Second, the actual layout often encounter multiple languages ​​mixed situation, then the problem will become more complex. This guide attempts to summarize some common rules in the use of punctuation in both Chinese and English for your reference.

** Chinese punctuation

The following rules apply to the use of Chinese punctuation [10]:
- Dash (-) Indicates the continuation of the tone or sound, takes up two Chinese characters space
- ellipsis (...) that save the original, the sentence is not complete or the tone of the discontinuous, take up two Chinese characters space
- Dashes and ellipses can not be broken or split into two lines because of an adaptive branch
- the closing quotation marks, the end brackets, the ending book number, the ellipsis, the connection number, the space number, and so on, can not appear at the beginning of a line
- start quotation marks, begin parentheses, start single or double the title of the symbol, etc., can not appear at the end of a line
- It is advisable to squeeze the free space of punctuation marks when starting the brackets, ending brackets, commas, commas, periods, and interval numbers to make the text type more compact and readable.
  - Most typesetting software has a punctuation function, please see the corresponding software manual rules

** English punctuation

The following rules apply to the use of punctuation in English [11]:
- commas, periods, semicolons, colon, exclamation point, question mark must be followed by a half space
- brackets around the same as the word and a half space, but after the bracket after the comma if it is not required to add a space
- The hyphen has no space before and after the principle, but sometimes it is necessary to fine-tune the kerning
- Slash for static "A or B" two parallel things, in principle, without spaces before and after

** Mixed punctuation in Chinese and English

Chinese and English punctuation in the form of very different, therefore, the correct use of punctuation to be done first do not mix punctuation:
- In pure Chinese environment, be sure to use [[https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%A8%E5%BD%A2%E5%92%8C%E5%8D%8A%E5% BD% A2] [full-width]] Chinese punctuation
- In plain English, be sure to use half-width English punctuation
- In the case of Chinese and English mixed in the context of Chinese and English, respectively, the use of the corresponding Chinese and English punctuation

# + CAPTION: Contrast differences between Chinese and English punctuation marks
# + NAME: table: difference-between-chinese-and-english-marks
English | Chinese |
| ---------------------------- + ------ + ------ |
| Full Stop / Period |. |. |

Exclamation Mark |! | |
| Comma |, |, |
| Colon |: |: |
| Semicolon |; |; |
| Parenthesis | () | () |
| Bracket | | | |
| Curly braces (Brace) | {} | {} |

** General rules

The following rules apply to the use of punctuation in both Chinese and English:
- punctuation suspension, to avoid a line at the beginning is a punctuation mark, you can layout software to automatically set the corresponding function or manually adjust
- List items ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(typography)][Bullet list]]) At the end of the sentence, we recommend no punctuation,
- It is recommended to add a half-size space between Arabic numerals and units
- use quotation marks ("'",''",""," "), do not use [[https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%92%87%E5%8F%B7 ][apostrophe]]

** Connection symbol

Hyphen, Hyphen, En-dash, and Em-dash are three punctuation marks that can easily be confused and cause errors in English typesetting. The use of these three different punctuation marks is described below.

# + BEGIN_QUOTE
For a hyphen, type a hyphen (-);

For an en-dash, type two hyphens (- \ / -);

For an em-dash, type three hyphens (- \ / - \ / -);

For a minus sign, type a hyphen in mathematics mode (\ $ - \ $).

--- Donald Knuth, / The TeXBook /
# + END_QUOTE

Hyphen (-)

The hyphen is used primarily for:

- compound words such as "upper-case letter"
- Separate numbers or characters, such as telephone numbers, "1-888-777-666"
- The word at the end of the line will be hyphenated in order to keep the layout uniform

There are a few rules about the end of the line:
- Try not to have three or more consecutive ligatures
- Avoid the use of proper nouns, names, etc. with a hyphen
- Avoid cross-page ligatures
- The position of ligature processing varies with different words. The basic principle is to segment the words according to the syllable. If necessary, it is best to check the dictionary. [12]

*** Half-width connector (En-dash, -)

En-dash, length equal to uppercase character N, is half of the full-width connector (Em-dash), mainly used for:
- Number of start and end ranges, such as year, "July - August 1968"
- the starting point of the address, such as "Boston-Hartford route"

When using the half-angle connector, generally do not need to add a space before and after.

*** Full-width connector (Em-dash, ---)

Full-width connector (Em-dash), equal to the length of uppercase characters M, the most flexible and complex usage, the usage can refer to the Chinese dash:
- Used to specify or explain, equivalent to parentheses or colons
- Used to separate boot clauses
- Indicates that the conversation is interrupted, in which case an ellipsis may be used instead

In addition, there are two, three full-width connector used together with the usage, not detailed here [13].

* Layout

Typography is a "two-dimensional building."

If the text and its font is the building material, then the layout design is the architectural drawings. Before discussing the layout design, we need to first clear some of the basic concepts, especially in the layout of the commonly used unit of size system.

** font size

Size (size) is a distinction between the size of the text of a measurement standard, the international common point system in China is based on the point system, supplemented by number system.

*** point system

Point system, also known as the pound system, is translated from English [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography)][Point]], abbreviated as pt. In typography, the point is the smallest unit of measurement. In fact, in different historical periods, the actual size of the point size is different. In the eighteenth century, the size of the point changed from 0.18 mm to 0.4 mm. In the 1980s and 1990s, as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing] [desktop publishing]] development, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_printing ] [Digital printing]] has largely replaced [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press] [movable type printing]] and has gradually established DTP point (desktop publishing point) as the industry standard.

The DTP point is defined as 1/72 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inch] [inch]].

The vast majority of typesetting fonts are optimized for 10-12 pt. In other words, in such a font size, whether it is the character itself frame structure, or character spacing will have a good effect [14]. The larger the font size, the more loose the text appears, so you need to manually reduce the character spacing; the other hand, the smaller font size, the text looks more compact, need to manually increase the character spacing.

# + CAPTION: Point units
# + NAME: table: dtp-point
| Pt | mm | cm | pica | inch |
| ---- + -------- + --------- + ------ + ------ |
1 | 0.3528 | 0.03528 | 1/12 | 1/72 |

*** system

In June 1985, the Ministry of Culture Publishing Management Bureau in order to innovate printing technology, improve the printing quality, put forward the movable type and the font standardization decision. (1 pt) is equal to 0.35 mm, the error does not exceed 0.005 mm, such as the fifth word is 10.5 points, or 3.675 mm. The size of the foreign type are calculated in points, that is, 1/72 inch, 0.5146 mm [10].

Number system is not in multiple of three movable type as the standard, according to double or half relationship into a system, there are four words, five words and six word system. The smaller the letter size, the larger the font size. 4 on the 5th than large, on the 6th than on the 5th small [15].

** Line spacing

Leading (Line-spacing) refers to the two lines of text between the baseline (Baseline) the distance between.

# + CAPTION: Leading
# + NAME: image: leading
[[Static / notes / guide / images / 1200px-Line_spacing_comparison.svg.png]]

Ideally spaced at least 120% of the font size in the read text [16].

Due to the different structures of the Chinese and Western characters, the line spacing should also be differentiated. Spanish characters due to ascending (ascender) and descending (descender), so the line spacing relative to Chinese characters can be set smaller, the proposed 1.2-1.5 times between the font size. In addition, different Western fonts have different x-height, in principle, x-height greater, the set spacing should also be larger, on the contrary, x-height smaller, the line spacing should be smaller.

Chinese characters as a result of the height of each block is basically the same, so the appropriate spacing can be increased, it is recommended to set the size of 1.5-1.8 times the font size.

** Page Layout

Layout is the layout design of the program, the outline is the purpose of Zhang. In addition to font size, line spacing of these common typesetting, resume layout there are some unique requirements. In principle, the best resume control in a page or less.
- Words and sentences, streamlining language
- Adjust the font size and line spacing within a reasonable range
- Adjust the margins, left and right symmetry, usually between 10-25 mm.
- Use lists rather than parallel sentences to list information
- Western Resume Careful use of both ends of the alignment, it is recommended to use the left alignment
  - Western words of different lengths, with both ends of the way it is easy to cause hyphenation and character spacing problems
- Chinese Resume It is recommended to use both ends of the alignment
  - Chinese character is a square word, in essence, is a monospaced font, so the default is justified at both ends
  - In both Chinese and English, it is recommended that both ends be aligned

** Chinese and Western mixed row

Chinese typesetting, Chinese characters and Latin characters, Greek characters or Arabic numerals and other Western mixed situation often occurs. In addition to the previously mentioned compound font and later in the English punctuation mixed, there are some additional rules, need attention.
- Use of full-width Spanish characters is prohibited when Chinese characters are mixed with Chinese characters
- Chinese and Western mixed, the proportion of the use of Western fonts, Arabic numerals can use the proportion of fonts or monospaced fonts
- Chinese characters and Western characters, the number between the proposal to add a certain margin, you can set the software to achieve high-level features through layout, you can manually add a half-size space
* Grammar

** Content

Resume CV, concise is the most important. Basic objective information is the core of the resume:
- Personal information
  - important contact information, such as telephone, e-mail must be clearly written
- Education background
  - If you are fresh, you can add a high school education background
- professional skill
- Award winning information
- Work (internship) experience

Subjective information should be used with caution:
- Self-evaluation
- personal hobby
- Social activities, volunteer experiences, etc., which are not clearly related to candidates' positions

Unrelated candidates should also be cautious to use the objective information (some state-owned enterprises may need):
- Photos
- Birthday
- Home address
- nation
- political status
- Marital and family status

Prohibited content:
- "Personal resume" word
Watermarks from Resume Template from Different Sources

** Spelling

A spelling mistake in a resume is a job search. Too many primary spelling mistakes can affect employers' first impressions of job seekers. Most software has a spell check function, appropriate to avoid a lot of primary spelling errors. Of course, do not over-reliance on the software's spell check function, it is best to find a trusted friend for the second proof-reading.

Proper nouns

In addition to the common English word spelling errors, proper nouns because of the more stringent capitalization requirements, is a high incidence of spelling errors. The same combination of characters, different capitalization, in different areas may have completely different meaning, job seekers must be cautious. For example, the lower case [[http://www.apple.com/ios/][iOS]] represents the mobile operating system on Apple iPhone devices, but all uppercase [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki / Cisco_IOS] [IOS]] is a dedicated system on a Cisco router.

Limited to the author's background, this guide summarizes some common spelling errors in the IT domain [17].

** Syntax

Non-native English job seekers often encounter a lot of grammar and user problems when writing their English resume. In addition, compared with ordinary English writing, resume writing there are some special grammar requirements, need to pay attention.

- If you describe the present work experience, use the present tense, otherwise use the past tense
- many in the past tense verb directly at the beginning, omit the subject
- Try to use simple and easy to understand phrases, but with a very long complex clause structure
- The educational background and work experience are listed in flashback format, and the time format should be written to the month
- The time format does not use year abbreviations. The format "05/06" has different interpretations in different countries. It can be interpreted in the standard format of "2015.05" or "June, 2015" format

** file format

Common resume formats include:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format][PDF]]
- Microsoft Word (doc, docx)
- Plain Text (plain text)
- HTML (web format)

Here is the primary recommendation of the PDF format:
- PDF has excellent cross-platform output quality, can guarantee almost 100% consistent printing and display
- PDF can be embedded in the font, the font selection has a great degree of freedom
- Default PDF reader on most platforms
  - Windows 8 and above built-in PDF reader
  - Mac OS X [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_(Mac_OS)][Preview]], iOS [[http://www.apple.com/ibooks/][iBooks]]
  - many browsers (such as Chrome) built-in [[http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/][pdf.js]], the default can also open the PDF

Word from the software is more easy to learn, but resume as a delivery, with Word format has a great disadvantage:
- Word documents need to install additional office software to open
  - Microsoft Word, [[https://wps.com] [WPS Office]] for Windows
  - Mac OS X can use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWork][iWork]]
  - [[https://wps.com] [WPS Office]], [[https://www.libreoffice.org/] [LibreOffice]] on Linux systems
  - Many online document editing systems such as [[https://docs.google.com/][Google Docs]]) can also open and edit Word documents
- Different documents in different platforms under different environments, Word document display is different
  - [[https://products.office.com/en-us/word][Microsoft Word]] is not actually available on everyone's computer.
  - Another fact is that genuine Microsoft Word is a licensing fee of several hundred dollars
- In order to ensure consistent display output results, Word document is best to use only a few common in the mainstream operating system fonts, which led to Word documents in the font selection on the freedom of small

Of course, different companies have different HR different requirements and preferences. Based on experience, foreign companies are more inclined to receive PDF, if Word to make a resume, it is recommended to export a PDF backup.

** Mail etiquette

In addition to the company's unique recruitment system, candidates should be the main resume delivery method of e-mail. Some basic mail etiquette is as follows:
- Set up the correct mailbox nickname, do not use the informal too fancy nickname, will give employers a very professional impression
  - Many QQ mailbox nickname is not formal enough, need special attention
- Message headers are recommended in a uniform format, with a clear and concise message that conveys the most important information
  - Proposed format: Candidate - Company Position - Name - [School / Education] - [Work Experience]
- E-mail text to be concise, do not recommend writing too long with a lot of personal subjective evaluation or emotional letter cover letter
  - the beginning of the text the best title to write, and add a greeting
  - Body content
    - Personal basic information, such as work status (working / leaving), what positions, academic experience, etc.
    - apply to position
    Job search channels, whether it was recommended
  - inscribed, including name, contact information (telephone / E-mail)
- Attachment Attach a complete resume file and name the file with reference to the message header format

[3] Need to be clear, here is said to be the song, bold and other Chinese font name, refers to the song, bold and other font form based on the design of the font family. For example, the song on Windows may be [[https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E6%98%93%E5%AE%8B%E4%BD%93] ]], And Mac OS X on the song may refer to the Chinese-song.

[4] Chinese characters in the main characters of the layout, usually need to be aligned at both ends, but to Western characters as the main text of the layout, when the width of the smaller layout is usually not suitable for both ends of the alignment, in which case if the mandatory two End alignment, most software will force the adjustment of character spacing, but the final layout effect is often very bad.
